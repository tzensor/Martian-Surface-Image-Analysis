# Martian-Surface-Image-Analysis

The Martian HiRISE dataset, available at JPL Dataverse (https://dataverse.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.48577/jpl.QJ9PYA), was developed to examine Mars' seasonal frost cycle and its impact on the planet's climate and surface evolution over the past approximately 2 billion years. The primary goal is to identify low-latitude frosted microclimates and their implications for Mars' climate. This research also aims to support future exploration missions by identifying potential habitable environments and resources for human explorers on Mars.

Previous studies of Mars' seasonal frost cycle were constrained by a trade-off between spatial coverage and resolution, forcing scientists to choose between global observations with coarse resolution or localized observations with higher resolution. To address these limitations, data science techniques are now being explored to detect frost globally using a combination of high-resolution visible and coarse-resolution thermal datasets. The dataset provided includes high-resolution visible data from the HiRISE instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), along with frost labels, facilitating the development of machine learning models for large-scale frost identification.

The project's objective is to develop models capable of distinguishing images of Martian terrain with frost, utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) image classification and transfer learning algorithms, specifically EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16.
